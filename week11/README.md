# Week 11 â€¢ Individual Meetings

## Assignment

- Based on this week's conversation, rework your priority list as needed, and
  continue working on your project.
- After next week, you'll have two (2) solid weeks to continue working on your
  project before our final class meeting.
- Summarize your project progress this week and decide how to best to present your project again next week in class. If you
  didn't get the kind of feedback in class last week (or this week) that you
  were looking for, how might you adjust your project presentation for next
  time? Include at least one (1) question to direct feedback, perhaps based on
  one of the [feedback menu
  options](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ne-FVdiwIy2AMkfTHDFBmw2DI80ZkRotReKnCPNcotY/edit#slide=id.g22c188a2f93_0_88).
