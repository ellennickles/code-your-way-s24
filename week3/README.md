## Assignment

### Part 1: Practice

Assemble and modify:

1. [Review loops](https://editor.p5js.org/enickles/sketches/Qo7DHHcFk)
  (directions in sketch)

Use the [Encode
process](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s24/blob/main/encode.md)
and analyze the visual output to predict the input code:

2. [Encode 1](https://editor.p5js.org/enickles/full/iu3hqCt1e)
3. [Encode 2](https://editor.p5js.org/enickles/full/sTAx_W5n_)

Use the [Decode
process](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s24/blob/main/decode.md)
and analyze the input code and predict the visual output:

4. [Decode
   1](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s24/blob/main/week3/decode1.js)
5. [Decode
   2](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s24/blob/main/week3/decode2.js)

### Part 2: Ask AI

Reinforce your understanding of new topic that you recently learned about this
week or in a past week by using the [AI
Student](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s24/blob/main/ai-assisted-learning.md#ai-as-student)
prompt. reflect on your experience with the tool and share your insights. Did
the AI accurately explain or illustrate the concept? Did anything unexpected
happen? Did you discover anything about your own understanding of the concept?
Did you check any external sources to assess the AI's output? Be sure to save the conversation for your documentation.

### Part 3: Re/Code

- Last week’s exercises used loops to repeat code. This week the idea is to
  practice using a loop’s local variable to increase values in the repeating
  code and increment visual characteristics to create a pattern(s). (You
  actually did this with the Decode 1 example last week, too.) This week's
  historical references do the same and also introduce random variation,
  sometimes to affect every element and other times to “interrupt” the repeating
  elements. Again, we’re working along the spectrum of structure and randomness.
- Recode one of the examples from this week’s featured artists. Or draw
  inspiration form some contemporary artists linked below. Or use an element
  previously created for this course (or another one) to generate a pattern and
  integrate random variation(s) in some way. If you worked in the grid with
  random features for the open-ended homework last week, then you're welcome to
  push that farther if you like. Everyone is welcome to work from
  inspiration you find anywhere! Be sure to consider all the possible visual
  characteristics to modify. Animation and interaction are encouraged for even
  more variation.

### Part 4: Document

- Write a blog post. Link to your sketches from Part 2 and Part 3.
- Same as last week: reflect on the discoveries and challenges you encountered
  during the exercises. What graphic or animation effects are most pleasing to
  you? Where did you get stuck, and what steps did you take to troubleshoot?
  What code-related techniques would you like to explore and practice more?
