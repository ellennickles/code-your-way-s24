## Assignment

### Part 1: Document and Keep Going

- Write an analysis of this week's user testing / feedback results.
- Rework your priority list as needed, and continue working on your project.
- Note any developments and milestones, including any unexpected challenges or
  breakthroughs.
- Include links to any code and references.

### Part 2: Sign up for an Individual Meeting (Zoom)

- We will not meet as a class next Monday, April 15.
- Instead plan to meet with Ellen in an individual meeting on
  [Zoom](https://nyu.zoom.us/my/ellennickles) to share your progress and
  a three-week timeline for the remaining weeks of the semester.
- (There might not be time to troubleshoot technical questions, but we can
  certainly set up a follow-up time to do that.)
- [Sign up

### Part 3: Keep Going and Three-week Timeline

- Keep working on your project.
- Summarize your progress so far and create a three-week timeline that
  represents what you can realistically accomplish in the next two weeks before
  before final project presentations.
- What are you doing and what have you done so far? What do you need to figure
  out? What steps do you need to take? What resources and support do you need?
  How much time? In what aspect(s) would you like feedback? (What are you unsure
  of conceptually, creatively, or technically?) Etc.
- [Submit your user feedback, current progress, and timeline
