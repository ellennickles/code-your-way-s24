## Assignment

We are transitioning to the second part of the course: an environment for
self-directed project development with the support of a classroom learning
community. The idea is to provide you with the necessary structure and timeline
to complete a single project or related series of smaller projects (e.g.
finishing multiple pieces for your portfolio). Use this course to help you accomplish your goal(s)!

There is no requirement to use specific aspects of programming. Focus on an
idea that excites you and choose the best programming concepts and tools to help
you realize it. You can take something you've already created for this course or
another one to develop further, or work on something entirely new.

Future class meetings will mix time to work on assignments (individually or in
groups on related projects), to share skills and resources, to share project
development, to user test and exchange feedback, and to conference with the
instructor. If topics of general interest emerge, we can take the time to cover
them in depth. Our course will culminate with a final project presentation.

To start this process, craft a proposal to share with our class to (1) practice
articulating your idea(s) and (2) to ask for constructive feedback about next
steps, overall direction, resources, or more.

### Part 1: Project Proposal

Research your project, collect some notes to answer the following questions, and
prepare to share your proposal in class next week:

- Ideas for a project title?
- Project description (max 100 words)
- Who is the user? (the intended audience can also be you)
- What is the user experience?
- What is the creative aesthetic/angle/approach?
- What technologies are required? Why?
- What do you need to learn/research/decide?
- What assets/content/code already exists? (your own sketches or other people's
  sketches)
- What assets/content/code needs to be created?
- What resources/books/sites/examples will you rely on?
- What is the end goal?
- How will you determine if this project is a success?
- Cite 3 sources of inspiration (How did you become interested in this idea?
  Quotes, photographs, products, projects, people, music, political events,
  social ills, etc.)
- Do you think all of this feasible in 7 weeks? Why?
- Questions for your classmates. What are you unsure of, conceptually and
  technically? On what aspect(s) would you like feedback?

### Part 2: Document

- Decide how to best to present your proposal to the class to address the above
  questions above and to obtain useful information for you to move forward.
  Everyone will ~4 minutes to share.
