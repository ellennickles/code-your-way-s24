## Command Line / Terminal / Shell

### Oh My Zsh!

Zsh, or the Z shell, is an application that interprets commands to interact
with your computer's operating system using your command line interface /
terminal. Oh My Zsh is a Zsh framework that provides additional customization
and functionality, including a Git plugin, which among _many_ other features
automatically displays when you are in a Git repository and the current branch.
