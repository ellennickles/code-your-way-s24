## Assignment

### Part 1: Finish your project

### Part 2: Document your project

- Document your final project in a blog post (or equivalent). It's up to you to
  figure out how to best document it.
- Here are some other loose guidelines to consider:
  - **Title** and/or one-sentence description
  - **Link** to project (if online)
  - **Project summary** • 250-500 words
  - **Inspiration** • How did you become interested in this idea? Quotes,
  photographs, products, projects, people, music, political events, social ills,
  etc.
  - **Process** • How did you make this? What were you able to implement easily
  and what was difficult? Did you run into unexpected challenges or
  breakthroughs? Do your best to explain why something worked or why it didn’t.
  - **Audience/context** • Who is this for? How will people experience it? Is it
  interactive? Is it practical? Is it for fun? Is it emotional? Is it to provoke
  something?
  - **Code references** • What examples, tutorials, references did you use to
  create the project?
  - **Next steps** • If you had/have more time to work on this, what would/will
  you do next?
- Submit here under [Week 13 - Final Project
  Documentation](https://forms.gle/ec4VxRgt8CtAjDGU7).

### Part 3: Share your project and your approach to programming

- Prepare a ~ three (3) minute presentation about your project that **( 1 )
  describes what you made** and **( 2 ) reflects on your approach to making it**.
- Ideally you learned more about your topic--and we can’t wait to hear about it!
  But also, what did you learn about your general approach to developing
  code-driven projects?
- Even though everyone’s general approach might be different, and every project
  has distinct conceptual and technical considerations, consider framing this
  reflection about your process in the form of general tips and strategies that
  might be of use to your classmates for their own current and future projects.
- For example:
  - How do you go about learning a new function, sensor, technique, framework, etc? What helps you learn something new in this field?
  - What attitudes, methods, and resources help you persevere through challenging programming moments?
  - Do you have any insights into your process, e.g. do you ever find yourself getting stuck at the same types of roadblocks? Are certain aspects easier than others?
  - Did you gain an awareness of what you might need to do to become a more
    proficient coder or to reach your goals?
- In your presentation, also feel free to include any questions to direct
  feedback about your project or approach(es).
