## Assignment

### Part 1: Set up

Make sure you have a blog, Google Doc, Notion, or some place online to document your work and reflect on your process this semester.

### Part 2: Encode

Use the [Encode
process](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s24/blob/main/encode.md)
to reverse engineer these sketches:

- [Encode 3](https://editor.p5js.org/enickles/full/Vdbb10E_x)

### Part 3: Ask AI

Pick a question that you wrote down during for Step 4 of the Encode process
(Annotate) from any of the sketches and for which you are still unsure or want
to understand better. Query a generative AI tool of your choice. Can you find an
answer to clarify your understanding? Be sure to save your prompt(s) and the
output(s) for your documentation. We'll compare notes on our processes and results next week.

### Part 4: Re/Code

- Create a loading icon (aka preloader or throbber) animation with code. Find
  and recode an existing one (different from the ones above) or design your own.
  Where do you often see these types of icons? Think of all the loading and
  waiting animations you encounter in your digital interactions, e.g. streaming
  video, connecting to devices, syncing accounts, payment transactions, etc. Are
  the icons related to waiting (or wasting) time? What does a loading icon
  communicate or hide? What aspect of experiencing time on a machine do you want
  to explore or express? (Source: [Aesthetic
  Programming](https://aesthetic-programming.net/))
- Make a plan with pseudocode. Write / draw an outline to guide you through the
  steps. It’s okay if you pivot from the original plan, the idea is to apply
  this approach to reverse engineer the algorithm.
- Practice reading and writing your own code and try not use an AI to help you;
  we'll get there soon enough. Remember that this course values critical
  reflection of process over product. Embrace experimentation and getting stuck. Related quote from Rick Rubin in *The
  Creative Act: A Way of Being*:

  > is the information you need
  > to get where you're going

### Part 5: Document

- Write a blog post. Link to your sketches from Part 2 and Part 4. Be sure to
  include the results from Part 3, too.
- Reflect on the discoveries and challenges you encountered during the
  exercises. What graphic or animation effects are most pleasing to you? Where
  did you get stuck, and what steps did you take to troubleshoot? What
  code-related techniques would you like to explore and practice more?
