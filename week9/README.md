## Assignment

### Part 1: User-testable Project

- Keep working on your project. The idea next week to share your project for
  feedback from everyone in our group.
- Though you're only a week in, use this opportunity to "test" a certain aspect
  of your project or the next stage in the project's development, and create a
  user-testable version.
- A user-testable version of your project will look / sound / behave differently
  for different types of projects. What will you test for and why? Or, what
  responses if any are you looking for and why?

### Part 2: Assess and Document

- As always, reflect on your progress again this week. What is/are the puzzle(s)
  you set out to solve this week? Document everything you tried and the
  outcome(s), even if things didn’t work out the way you wanted. Did you run
  into unexpected challenges or breakthroughs? Do you need to shift your
  approach? Do you need different or additional resources? Revisit the goals in
  your proposal. Do you need to revise anything?
- For your user testing consider the kind of feedback that will be most useful
  for your project's development. Prepare some open-ended questions for your
  testers that focus on specific aspects of your project that you’re unsure of
  or want to know more about.
- Include links to any code and references.
