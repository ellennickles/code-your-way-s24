## Assignment

- Due in two weeks
- Practice as much as you can in **Visual Studio Code**. Part of this week's
  assignment is getting accustomed to working in this new environment. The other
  part is continuing to practice programming.

### Part 1: Practice

Some of these are tricky. Do the best you can to get a sense of the logical and
visual pattern(s). Your choice:
[Encode](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s24/blob/main/encode.md)
(output to input) or
[Decode](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s24/blob/main/decode.md)
(input to output)

- Exercise 1: [Encode](https://editor.p5js.org/enickles/full/ioXnSfKXD) or
  [Decode](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s24/blob/main/week4/decode1.js)
- Exercise 2: [Encode](https://editor.p5js.org/enickles/full/tuRBCkhGQ) or
  [Decode](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s24/blob/main/week4/decode2.js)
- Exercise 3: [Encode](https://editor.p5js.org/enickles/full/kZzj9Atg1) or
  [Decode](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s24/blob/main/week4/decode3.js)
- Exercise 4: [Encode](https://editor.p5js.org/enickles/full/Y_x3PiIpy) or
  [Decode](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s24/blob/main/week4/decode4.js)
- **Extra** Exercise 5:
  [Encode](https://editor.p5js.org/enickles/full/2FIH2NzfY) or
  [Decode](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s24/blob/main/week4/decode5.js)
  ([this video](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/77-recursion) might help)

### Part 2: Re/Code

- Extending our work with loops and patterns (our last week of grids?!),
  progression is the theme this week: how can you represent continuous change(s)
  within the composition color, position, size, speed, etc. and/or over time? Is
  the quality of change gradual or uneven? For example, can you make an
  interactive sketch that maps order to chaos based on the mouse position, e.g.
  “order” on the left and “chaos” on the right (prompt from _Code as a Creative
  Medium_)? Can you extend an example or self-designed sketch from previous
  weeks with this week’s theme. If you worked with gradients in the past, what
  are other ways to demonstrate a shift? Just some ideas to get started, in
  addition to those in the Class Slides.

### Part 3: Document

- Write a blog post. Copy and paste any code from VS Code into the p5 web
  editor, so you can link to your sketches. I know this is redundant, but for
  now this is the easiest way to share.
- Same as last week: reflect on the discoveries and challenges you encountered
  during the exercises. What graphic or animation effects are most pleasing to
  you? Where did you get stuck, and what steps did you take to troubleshoot?
  What code-related techniques would you like to explore and practice more?
