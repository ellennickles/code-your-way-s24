## Assignment

Create the "[Hello
World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program)" version of
your project. Depending on your project this can take different
forms, but the general idea is to start doing and making. It doesn't have to be
the best thing you've ever made. Just start to get started. Think Anne Lamott's
"[Shitty First
Drafts](https://wrd.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/1-Shitty%20First%20Drafts.pdf)"
from *Bird by Bird*.

Is your project goal...

**...product-oriented?** *I want to make X...or a series of Xs*

- If you are starting a new project, make one bare-bones piece of functionality.
- If you are making a custom website, publish your [Hello World
  site](https://ellennicklesdemo.github.io/helloworld/) on a static hosting
  service such as [GitHub
  Pages](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s24/blob/main/version-control-guides/tips-and-tricks.md#github-pages),
  [Glitch](https://glitch.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), etc.
- If you are returning to a previous project, choose one area on which to focus
  this week (e.g. does it need a major refactor session? does it need some
  expanded functionality? does it need graphic design? does it need to be
  deployed live? does it need to meet [web accessibility
  standards](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility)?)
- If you are making a series of related code-driven pieces, make at least one to
  share next week.

**...process-oriented?** *I want to learn, practice, get better at X*

- If you are learning a new programming library (e.g. Three.js) or practicing a
  technique/strategy, make at least one thing to apply your understanding and start building momentum.
- If you are improving on a previously-learned code-related skill or strategy
  (e.g. from another class), then demonstrate your effort to expand your
  understanding. Ways to demonstrate your progress include re-making from
  scratch something you made earlier (e.g. whatever you made last week, make
  it again), refactoring old code, annotating the code in a previous project,
  and/or recording yourself explaining how the code works.

### Part 1: Define Hello World Goal

Use [SMART criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) to create a
clear and realistic road map for yourself this week*:

1. Specific
    - What is your project's Hello World? Be specific.
    - This is the mission statement for your goal.
    - What actions will you take? Don’t hesitate to get very detailed.
2. Measurable
    - What does success for your goal look like? (How much? How well?)
    - Are there specific tasks and deadlines to set as milestones in order to
      complete the main goal?
3. Achievable
    - Is the goal doable?
    - Does it inspire motivation over discouragement?
    - Is the goal realistic? Consider any obstacles or requirements to help you
      decide.
    - Do you have the necessary knowledge, experience, tools, skills, resources,
      and time? For example:
      - What technologies are required? Why?
      - What do you need to learn / research / decide?
      - What assets / content / code already exists?
      - What assets / content / code needs to be created?
      - What resources / books / sites / examples will you rely on?
    - If you don't have these, then what will it take to attain them?
    - Do you need to update your expectations?
4. Relevant
    - How does your project's Hello World relate to or align with the goals in
      your original proposal?
    - What will this Hello World help you do next, in the near or distant
      future?
5. Time-bound
    - Can you do it in a week?
    - Setting realistic timing improves your chances of succeeding.
    - Time constraints also create a sense of urgency.

*Language adapted from [University of California's SMART Goals: A How to
Guide](https://www.ucop.edu/local-human-resources/_files/performance-appraisal/How%20to%20write%20SMART%20Goals%20v2.pdf) (PDF)

### Part 2: Create Hello World

### Part 3: Assess and Document

- Reflect on your progress. What is/are the puzzle(s) you set out to solve this
  week? Document everything you tried and the outcome(s), even if things didn’t
  work out the way you wanted. Did you run into unexpected challenges or
  breakthroughs? Do you need to shift your approach? Do you need different or
  additional resources? Revisit the goals in your proposal. Do you need to
  revise anything?
- Include links to any code and references, including documentation from any
  generative AI tools.
