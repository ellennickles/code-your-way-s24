## Assignment

- The ideas this week are to practice refactoring code that you have already
  written and continue practicing Git version control. **Tip:** Working
  with branches in git fits will code refactoring! Consider installing the [Oh
  My Zsh shell framework](add link) to automatically display when you are in a
  Git repository along with the current branch.

### Part 1: Refactor + Git

- Create a local directory with a p5 project, initialize it at as a [Git
  repository](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s24/blob/main/version-control-guides/git.md#create-a-git-repository),
  and refactor a previous sketch so that the output is the same but
  the the code has been restructured.
- You can refactor a sketch from this course or another one. If your sketch is
  in the p5 web editor, copy and paste the code into your local p5 project on
  your computer.
- Challenge yourself to refactor a prior sketch that you really enjoyed but
  feels messy because you ran out or time, have a different understanding
  of how to implement programming concepts, and/or you have inklings that the
  code could be written in more efficient ways, i.e. "bad smells"
- As you refactor, commit notable changes or milestones:
  - Look for repeating elements to convert into a loop, a function, or a class
    to make objects.
  - Is there any unused code to remove?
  - Can you make your code more readable? e.g. Any variables or functions to
    rename so that someone else reading your code can follow along without
    needing comments?
  - Adding comments are okay too! Especially to reinforce YOUR understanding
    of programming concepts and how your sketch works.
  - If there’s a lot of code, can you organize separate into different
    files? (See [Coding Train video on how organize your code into multiple
    JavaScript files](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/code-programming-with-p5-js/code/6-objects/4-editor-js-files).)
  
### Part 2: Document

- Write a blog post that includes a link to your refactored code.
- Describe and reflect on the changes you made and why you made them. How did it
  go with Git this week? For all of it (including the coding part), where did
  you get stuck, and what steps did you take troubleshoot? Anything that you
  would like to explore and practice more?
