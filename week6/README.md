## Assignment

- The ideas this week are to practice refactoring code and storing code on
  GitHub.

### Part 1: Refactor + Git

- Create a local directory with a p5 project, initialize it at as a [Git
  repository](https://github.com/ellennickles/code-your-way-s24/blob/main/version-control-guides/git.md#create-a-git-repository),
  and refactor a previous sketch so that the output is the same but
  the the code has been restructured.
- You can refactor a sketch from this course or another one. If your sketch is
  in the p5 web editor, copy and paste the code into your local p5 project on
  your computer.
- Challenge yourself to refactor a prior sketch that you really enjoyed but
  feels messy because you ran out or time, have a different understanding
  of how to implement programming concepts, and/or you have inklings that the
  code could be written in more efficient ways, i.e. "bad smells"
- As you refactor, commit notable changes or milestones:
  - Look for repeating elements to convert into a loop, a function, or a class
    to make objects.
  - Is there any unused code to remove?
  - Can you make your code more readable? e.g. Any variables or functions to
    rename so that someone else reading your code can follow along without
    needing comments?
  - Adding comments are okay too! Especially to reinforce YOUR understanding
    of programming concepts and how your sketch works.
  - If there’s a lot of code, can you organize separate into different
    files? (See [Coding Train video on how organize your code into multiple
    JavaScript files](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/code-programming-with-p5-js/code/6-objects/4-editor-js-files).)
  
### Part 2: Document + GitHub

- Push your repository to your GitHub account. Write a blog post that includes
  the original code and a link to the refactored code in GitHub.
- Describe and reflect on the changes you made and why you made them. How did it
  go with Git and GitHub this week? For all of it (including the coding part),
  where did you get stuck, and what steps did you take troubleshoot? Anything
  that you would like to explore and practice more?
- [Submit here](https://forms.gle/ec4VxRgt8CtAjDGU7)

### Part 3: Prepare for next class

- After spring break, we’ll transition to the second part of the course in
  which you’ll work on an independent project (which could also be a series of
  smaller projects) of your choice. (And practice programming concepts and
  strategies from the first half of semester even more!)
- We'll talk a bit about independent projects in our next class. Start pondering
  / brainstorming what you might like to do and be prepared to informally share
  some nascent ideas when we meet.
