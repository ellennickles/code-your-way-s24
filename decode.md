# Decode

*A process modified from the
[PRIMM](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/primm-talk-in-programming-lessons-research-seminar/)
approach ([official website](https://primmportal.com/))

Steps to start practicing reading and interpreting the code before running
sketches:

1. **Predict** • Before you run the sketch, look at the code and decide what it
   will do.
    - Read through the code as if "you" were executing it like the computer, line by line.
    - What elements will appear? What will they look like, and how will they
      behave?
    - How many are there? Are they related to one another? How?
    - What's the logic or flow structure?
    - If it helps, draw what you think the output will be.
2. **Run** • Run the sketch and test your prediction(s). Is the output what you
   expected?
3. **Investigate** • Go back to the code and map the individual lines or blocks
   of code to the output features that you observed when you ran the sketch. If
   it helps to test/reinforce your understanding, try:
    - Logging the values of variables and operations to the Console instead of
      calculating them in your head, i.e. `console.log(some variable or
      operation)`
    - Changing function parameters and variable values in substantial ways.
    - Commenting out parts of the code to see what happens or to help you focus
      on smaller sections at a time.
    - Write tracing statements to test the order in which statements are
      executing.
    - Consulting the resources for the assignment if you see anything new.
4. **Annotate** • Duplicate the sketch into your own p5 account, and comment the
   code to explain what the different parts do, i.e. can you tell the story of
   the program?
    - If you need to, annotate each line, especially those with functions,
      syntax, and techniques that are new to you.
    - For example: describe how a function's parameters work, e.g. instead of //
      draws a circle, include the how: // the x parameter is the circle's
      distance from the origin of the canvas.
    - If you get stuck, write yourself a question to return to later.
5. **Modify** • Use your understanding of the code to change it and make it do
   different things. Make it your own; modify the code in some way to make it
   distinct from the original. If there’s something tricky that you’re still
   wrapping your head around, use that as a starting point. For example, try:
    - Changing the appearance by playing with scale, speed, color, etc.
    - Reordering lines or blocks of code.
    - Simplifying or extending the sketch, e.g. removing code or adding more
      functionality.
    - Make it interactive!
