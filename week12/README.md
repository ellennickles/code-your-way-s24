## Assignment

- For whatever you decide to do, please submit a project update before class,
  summing up your timeline progress to date and what you want to accomplish
  during next week’s class time, as well as during the final week of the
  semester.
- If you are user testing, what are you testing and why? If you plan to use the
  time to work on your project, what’s the task / question you’re addressing?
